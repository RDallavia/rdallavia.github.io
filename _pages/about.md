<p>Welcome to my codefolio!  Here, you'll find my CV and select projects from the data science and machine learning domains of AI.</p> 

<p>For the curious, while I have a quantitative master's, my humble journey in data science/machine learning began in the Department of Sociology at William & Mary. My undergraduate work with the university's Office of Intitutional Research, as well as demographic and organizational data, spurred my interest in the subject.</p> 

<p>I built upon this core competency in my graduate studies in finance, where I took additional coursework in advanced statistics and time-series forecasting.</p>

<p>Data science and machine learning evolved rapidly post graduate school. To keep my skills sharp and relevant, MIT's OpenCourseware, Harvard's CS50x courses, and Andrew Ng's famed machine learning course at Stanford proved to be invaluable. </p>

<p> Having completed the aforementioned coursework, in addition to using time-series forecasting (i.e., machine learning) in my own practice, I'm ready to jump into data science optimized for learning and impact.</p>

<p> The pages contained in this portfolio are self-explanatory. To see a long version of my CV, simply click on the CV link. The portfolio link will take you to the projects described on my CV.</p> 

<p>Should you wish to see something that is not here, I'm more than willing to entertain requests from recruiters.</p>

Enjoy!
