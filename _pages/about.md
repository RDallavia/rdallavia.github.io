<p>Welcome to my codefolio! Here, you'll find my CV and select projects from the machine learning domain of AI.  The samples herein represent in-memory processes due to space limitations and the more formidable barrier of the cost of cloud computing. Still, you will find some works that provide a window into what statistics at scale might look like (i.e., statistical problems turned optimization problems).</p> 

<p>For the curious, while I have a quantitative master's my humble journey in data science/machine learning began in the Department of Sociology at William & Mary. My undergraduate work with university generated data sets, as well as demographic and organizational data, spurred my interest in the subject.</p> 

<p>I built upon this core competency in my graduate studies in finance, where I took additional coursework in advanced statistics and time-series forecasting.</p>

<p>The discipline evolved rapidly post graduate school. I found MIT OpenCourseware, Harvard's CS50x courses, and Andrew Ng's famed machine learning course from Stanford to be invaluable tools in refreshing and expanding my computer science and data science skill set. </p>

<p> Having completed the aforementioned coursework, in addition to reading countless books and sitting for a bootcamp to tie it all together, do I know everything? No, I'm quite far from knowing anything close to "everything". LLMs, RAGs, GenAI, and other acronyms are on everyone's lips. Previously completed studies, like those mentioned above, taught me how to teach myself and, thus, readied me for the challenge of understanding these models should the occasion arise. Further studies and work experience will undoubtedly prepare me to make an impact on this exciting field of inquiry.</p>

<p> The pages contained in this portfolio are self-explanatory. To see a long version of my CV, simply click on the CV link. The portfolio link will take you to a respository of some of my favorite projects. Should you wish to see something that is not here, I'm more than willing to entertain requests from recruiters.
