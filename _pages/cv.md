Education
======
* M.S., Finance, University of Wisconsin - Madison
* B.A., <i>cum laude</i>, Sociology - Complex Organizations, William & Mary

Projects
======
* Ticket price analysis for ski resort seeking an increase in ROI through a potential price hike and insight into the beneficent effects of a recent investment on company performance. <strong> Results of random-forest model indicated ticket prices could be increased by over 30%. </strong> Addressed research questions using internal company data and external data from comparable resorts.  Workflow consisted of data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, and modelling.  Technologies used included Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, NumPy, Seaborn, & Matplotlib.

* “Is There Anything On?” <strong> This low-rank, collaborative movie recommendation engine yielded 10 movie recommendations of which 70% were consistent with user preferences versus a hierarchical clustering approach that produced only 3 recommendations out of 10 that were deemed watchable. </strong> The low-rank approach relies on the family of matrix decomposition/factorization techniques popularized during the Netflix recommendation engine challenge of 2006. Technology used included Python, SciPy, NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib.

* “That’s Unusual.”  This Gaussian anomaly detection model was used to identify networked servers worthy of inspection.  <strong> Several non-obvious servers were tagged as anomalous, which would allow a sys admin to intervene before the servers malfunctioned and avoid checking functional servers unnecessarily. </strong> This technology can be used in fraud detection. The tech stack used included Python, SciPy, NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib.

* "Who's Who in our Database?" Hierarchical and k-means clustering models were used to segment an airline customer database to search for similarities among users. 6 groups were chosen based on a dendrogram, and the shared characteristics within each cohort were noted.  Though this type of unsupervised learning does not result in a prediction, <strong> the insights it yields could be used as the foundation for a targeted marketing campaign. </strong>  Written in R and relying primarily on tidyverse and caret.

*	Code 312: Non-profit, volunteer organization of software developers in the Chicago area.  Currently <strong> expanding the site for The Chicago Council on Science and Technology </strong> and migrating said site to GitHub Projects.
