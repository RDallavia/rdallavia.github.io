excerpt: "A customer segmentation model using both hierarchical and k-means clustering. These methods illustrate classic cases of unsupervised learning. Though unsupervised methods do not yield a prediction, the insight gleaned from a data mining exploration of this type can be used to guide, for example, the implementation of targeted marketing campaigns. The study is written in R and depends largely on the tidyverse and caret packages.. <br> <img src='/images/whoswho.jpeg'>"
