title: "<strong><a href='https://nbviewer.org/github/RDallavia/samples/blob/main/CustomerSegmentation/CustomerSegmentation.ipynb'>Who's Who in our Customer Database? A study in data mining and clustering. </a></strong>"
excerpt: "Customer segmentation models using both hierarchical and k-means clustering were constructed. These methods illustrate classic cases of unsupervised learning. Though unsupervised methods do not yield a prediction, the insight gleaned from a data mining exploration of this type can be used to guide, for example, the implementation of targeted marketing campaigns. The study is written in R and depends largely on the tidyverse and caret packages.. <br> <img src='/images/whoswho.jpeg'>"
