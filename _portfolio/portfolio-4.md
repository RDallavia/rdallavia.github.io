title: "<strong><a href='https://nbviewer.org/github/RDallavia/samples/blob/main/Pricing_Analytics/Notebooks/05_modeling.ipynb'>Resort Pricing Study -- Modelling</a></strong>"
excerpt: "In this notebook, we now take our model for ski resort ticket price and leverage it to gain some insights into what price Big Mountain's facilities might actually support, as well as explore the sensitivity of changes to various resort parameters. Note, this relies on the implicit assumption that all other resorts are largely setting prices based on how much people value certain facilities. This means comparable prices are set correctly. <br> <img src='/images/model.jpeg'>"
