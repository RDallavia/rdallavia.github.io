excerpt: "Here, we'll start building machine learning models. Before diving into modelling, however, we'll begin by considering how useful the mean value is as a predictor. We never want to go to stakeholders with a machine learning model only to have the CEO point out that it performs worse than just guessing the average! Our first model is always a baseline performance comparitor for any subsequent model. Next, we'll build up the process of efficiently creating robust models to compare to our baseline forecast. <br> <img src='/images/pipeline.jpeg'>"
