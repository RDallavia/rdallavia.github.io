title: "<strong><a href='https://nbviewer.org/github/RDallavia/samples/blob/main/Pricing_Analytics/Notebooks/02_data_wrangling.ipynb'>Resort Pricing Study -- Data Wrangling</a></strong>"
excerpt: Our client is Big Mountain (a/k/a "the Client", "the Company"), a Montana-based ski resort. Management at Big Mountain suspects it may not be maximizing its return on investment (ROI) relative to its peers in the market. Furthermore, Company insiders also lack a strong sense of which facilities matter most to visitors, particularly ones for which skiers are likely to pay more. This project aims to build a predictive model for ticket price based on resort assets so as to assist the company in maximizing its ROI, while at the same time providing intel on which assets are most valued by customers. The latter will guide Big Mountain's capital expenditure decisions going forward."<img src='/images/Cat.jpeg'>"
