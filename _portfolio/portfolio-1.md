excerpt: "Our client is Big Mountain (a/k/a 'the Client', 'the Company'), a Montana-based ski resort. Management at Big Mountain suspects it may not be maximizing its return on investment (ROI) relative to its peers in the market. Furthermore, Company insiders also lack a strong sense of which facilities matter most to visitors, particularly ones for which skiers are likely to pay more. To address these issues, we begin by wrangling the data provided by the client."</br> <img src='/images/Cat.jpeg'>"
